# 🚀 SQL-Powered Feature Adoption Analysis for a Product Launch
This project leverages SQL and Amplitude Analytics to analyze feature adoption and user engagement after a product launch. SQL is used to process and structure raw event data, while Amplitude provides real-time insights into user interactions, retention, and conversion trends.

# 🛠 Technology Stack
✅ SQL Server – Data extraction, transformation, and aggregation
✅ Amplitude Analytics – User event tracking and visualization
✅ GitHub – Project documentation & version control

# 🔍 Why SQL?
SQL is essential for handling large-scale event data before uploading it to Amplitude. Key uses include:
📊 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Extracting relevant user event logs
📈 Trend Analysis – Calculating key feature adoption metrics
📌 Exporting Data – Preparing structured CSVs for Amplitude integration
