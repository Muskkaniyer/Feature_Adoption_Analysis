# 🚀 SQL-Powered Feature Adoption Analysis for a Product Launch
This project leverages SQL and Amplitude Analytics to analyze feature adoption and user engagement after a product launch. SQL is used to process and structure raw event data, while Amplitude provides real-time insights into user interactions, retention, and conversion trends.

# 🛠 Technology Stack
✅ SQL Server – Data extraction, transformation, and aggregation
 
✅ Amplitude Analytics – User event tracking and visualization

✅ GitHub – Project documentation & version control

# 🔍 Why SQL?
SQL is essential for handling large-scale event data before uploading it to Amplitude. Key uses include:

📊 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing – Extracting relevant user event logs

📈 Trend Analysis – Calculating key feature adoption metrics

📌 Exporting Data – Preparing structured CSVs for Amplitude integration

# 🔹 SQL-Powered Insights
📌 How many users find my feature every day?

Insight: Track Daily Active Users (DAU)—the number of unique users interacting with the feature each day.

SELECT CAST(event_time AS DATE) AS event_date, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS daily_active_users
FROM user_events
WHERE event_type = 'feature_used'
GROUP BY CAST(event_time AS DATE)
ORDER BY event_date DESC;



📌 How often do users get value from your feature?

Insight: Measures how frequently users return to use the feature.

SELECT user_id, COUNT(event_id) AS usage_count
FROM user_events
WHERE event_type = 'feature_used'
GROUP BY user_id
ORDER BY usage_count DESC;



📌 Which platforms do users experience my feature on?

Insight: Shows feature adoption across different platforms (e.g., Web, iOS, Android).

SELECT platform, COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS user_count
FROM user_events
WHERE event_type = 'feature_used'
GROUP BY platform
ORDER BY user_count DESC;



📌 What percentage of users find your feature for the first time each week?

Insight: Tracks new user adoption trends on a weekly basis.

WITH first_time_users AS (
    SELECT user_id, MIN(event_time) AS first_use_date
    FROM user_events
    WHERE event_type = 'feature_used'
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT DATEPART(WEEK, first_use_date) AS week_number, 
       COUNT(user_id) AS new_users
FROM first_time_users
GROUP BY DATEPART(WEEK, first_use_date)
ORDER BY week_number DESC;



📌 After users discover your feature, how many get value from it?

Insight: Measures conversion from feature discovery to feature usage.

WITH viewed_users AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM user_events WHERE event_type = 'feature_viewed'
),
used_users AS (
    SELECT DISTINCT user_id FROM user_events WHERE event_type = 'feature_used'
)
SELECT COUNT(used_users.user_id) * 100.0 / COUNT(viewed_users.user_id) AS conversion_rate
FROM viewed_users
LEFT JOIN used_users ON viewed_users.user_id = used_users.user_id;



📌 How long does it take users to find value in your feature?

Insight: Calculates the time between feature discovery (viewed) and feature adoption (used).

WITH time_to_use AS (
    SELECT user_id, 
           MIN(CASE WHEN event_type = 'feature_viewed' THEN event_time END) AS first_viewed,
           MIN(CASE WHEN event_type = 'feature_used' THEN event_time END) AS first_used
    FROM user_events
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT AVG(DATEDIFF(MINUTE, first_viewed, first_used)) AS avg_time_to_value
FROM time_to_use
WHERE first_viewed IS NOT NULL AND first_used IS NOT NULL;


📌 How many users return after getting value from my feature?

Insight: Measures retention rate by tracking users who return after their first successful feature use.

WITH first_usage AS (
    SELECT user_id, MIN(event_time) AS first_used_date
    FROM user_events
    WHERE event_type = 'feature_used'
    GROUP BY user_id
)
SELECT DATEDIFF(DAY, first_usage.first_used_date, ue.event_time) AS return_days, 
       COUNT(DISTINCT ue.user_id) AS returning_users
FROM first_usage
JOIN user_events ue ON first_usage.user_id = ue.user_id AND ue.event_type = 'feature_used'
WHERE DATEDIFF(DAY, first_usage.first_used_date, ue.event_time) > 0
GROUP BY DATEDIFF(DAY, first_usage.first_used_date, ue.event_time)
ORDER BY return_days ASC;



📌 How many times does a user explore my feature on average?

Insight: Measures the average number of feature interactions per user.

SELECT COUNT(event_id) * 1.0 / COUNT(DISTINCT user_id) AS avg_feature_usage
FROM user_events
WHERE event_type = 'feature_used';


# 📈 Amplitude-Powered Analytics
Amplitude is a product analytics platform that helps track user interactions, visualize feature adoption, and measure retention trends. With SQL-powered insights, we can integrate Amplitude to gain real-time, actionable insights into user behavior.

# 📊 How We Use Amplitude Dashboards
✅ Event Segmentation: Track DAU, user engagement, and platform adoption.

✅ Retention & Cohort Analysis: Measure repeat users and long-term feature adoption.

✅ Funnel Analysis: Optimize the user journey from feature discovery to retention.

✅ Breakdown & Segmentation: Understand user behavior based on device, platform, or demographics.
